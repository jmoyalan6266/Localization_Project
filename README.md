# Localization_Project
My group and I worked on a research project designed to autonomously localize the BWI bots at startup. Following this, we collaboratively wrote a research paper and presented our processes and results for peer review.
Our method consisted of the BWI bots moving around randomly until they recognized an AR marker which would have it's location stored in a text file.
Using this location, we transform the vector location to get the robots location in the GDC.
